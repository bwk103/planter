# Planter

This application is currently a work in progress.

## Problem

Having recently purchased my first home, I inherited the responsibilities of maintaining a lawn and a range of garden plants for the first time. However, having never been particularly green fingered, and despite my best efforts, a number of the plants unfortunately perished under my care.  

I therefore sought to produce an application which would manage a database of the plants in my garden which would provide tips on maintaining a healthy garden and notify users when any plant required attention.

## Aims

I am in the process of producing an application which adheres to the following technical specifications:

- Built using a Node.js and Express.js backend;
- Reads and writes to a NoSQL database (MongoDB);
- Uses Angular as a single page web application on the front-end.

The application should, once completed, offer users the following features:

- Users can register/ log in / log out;
- Users can add a number of plants to their own 'garden';
- Users can inspect those plants for tips on their maintenance;
- Users are provided with recent weather information based on their location; and
- Users are provided with notifications if any plant/lawn requires essential maintenance.
